# Price-Comparison-Tool
The Price Comparison Tool is a Python program that allows users to compare the prices of a specific item across multiple stores. After entering store names and their prices, the program determines which store offers the lowest price and displays the result. This helps users make smarter and more cost-efficient purchasing decisions.
Many consumers buy products without checking whether better prices are available elsewhere. Manually comparing prices from different stores is inconvenient and time-consuming. A simple automated tool can assist users by quickly identifying the best available price.
